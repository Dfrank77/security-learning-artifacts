# Security Learning Artifacts (IAM)

Practical IAM-focused artifacts built from hands-on labs in Microsoft Entra ID and related identity tooling.
This repo contains short, resume-friendly write-ups that document configuration decisions, validation steps, and security rationale.

## Artifacts
- [Conditional Access MFA Lab (Build + Validation)](entra/conditional-access-mfa-lab.md)
- [Entra Sign-in Log Triage Checklist](entra/sign-in-log-triage-checklist.md)
- [PIM Role-Assignable Admin Group (Request + Approval + Audit Chain)](entra/pim-role-assignable-admin-group.md)
- [Entra PIM Lab: Global Administrator as Eligible (JIT Access)](entra/pim-global-admin-lab.md)
- [Access Reviews: Interpretation Guide](entra/access-reviews-interpretation-guide.md)

## Scope / Notes
- Lab-tenant only. No employer or sensitive tenant data included.
- Goal: demonstrate real-world IAM patterns (least privilege, just-in-time elevation, auditability, access reviews).
